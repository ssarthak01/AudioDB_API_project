This project involves the use of the Audio DB API, where a user is able to view artists and learn more about them through a biography on the website, as well as post a review and see other users' reviews. The app is built using Node.js with EJS front end templating. Data is being pulled from the public Audio DB API using Axios, and database management is done through MongoDB and SQL queries.
